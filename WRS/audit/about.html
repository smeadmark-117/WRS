                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Established in 2012, White Rock Specialties is a joint venture between Sheldon Rockey of Rockey Farms and the multi-generational family at White Mountain Farm. Located in the renovated Sangre de Cristo High School building in Mosca, Colorado, we operate a dedicated organic packing facility designed to meet the highest standards of food safety. We specialize in handling organic potatoes for our White Mountian Farm and select growers across the San Luis Valley.</p>
                    <p>Our story is one of innovation and dedication to sustainable agriculture. Recognizing a growing need for a specialized facility to handle organic and specialty potatoes, Sheldon Rockey and Paul New transformed the abandoned Sangre de Cristo High School into a state-of-the-art packing warehouse. This unique repurposing not only provided a modern facility but also breathed new life into a historic community landmark.</p>
                    <p>White Rock Specialties is a Certified Organic handling facility (certified by the Colorado Department of Agriculture). We are proud to contribute to the economic vitality of Alamosa County, shipping high-quality organic potatoes coast-to-coast year-round.</p>
