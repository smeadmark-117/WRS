## 2. DESIGN SYSTEM

### Visual Identity (Logos)
* **Primary Text Brand:** **"WRS"**
    * *Style:* Heavy, stylized sans-serif (mimicking the hand-painted black lettering on the facility wall).
    * *Color:* Utility Black (`#111111`).
* **Graphic Icon:** **White Potato Flower on Sage Green**
    * *Usage:* Use this as the "Favicon" and as a brand mark next to the "WRS" header.
    * *Visual:* A simple white vector illustration of a potato flower centered on a Sage Green circle or square.

### Color Palette (Strict)
* **Backgrounds:** Clean White (`#FFFFFF`) - mimics sanitary block walls.
* **Text & Headers:** Utility Black (`#111111`) - mimics the baseboards/signage.
* **Accents/Buttons:** Mosca Sage (`#78866B`) - mimics the facility wall stripe. *Use this for all buttons and active links.*
* **Alerts/Status:** Deep Red (`#A61A1A`) - only for "At Capacity" or "Do Not Park" indicators.

### Typography
* **Headers:** `Impact`, `Oswald`, or a heavy slab-serif. Bold, industrial, uppercase.
* **Body:** `Arial`, `Roboto`, or `Helvetica`. High legibility, standard sans-serif.
