### **Key Business Details**
* **Industry:** Agriculture / Produce Packaging & Shipping
* **Primary Product:** Certified Organic potatoes (Russets, Reds, Yellows, Fingerlings, and other specialty varieties).

### **History & Formation**
* **Establishment (2012):** The company was formed around 2012/2013 when Sheldon Rockey and Paul New recognized a growing need for a dedicated packing facility that could handle organic and specialty potatoes, which require different handling than conventional bulk potatoes.
* **The Facility:** One of the most unique aspects of the business is its facility. The partners purchased the **old Sangre de Cristo High School building** in Mosca, which had been closed. They retrofitted the abandoned school into a state-of-the-art packing warehouse, repurposing the gym and other areas for sorting, grading, and packing lines.
* **Growth:** The venture was supported by loans guaranteed by the USDA Rural Development program. It quickly reached capacity in its first year, leading to further expansions and job creation in Alamosa County, an area historically challenged by economic factors.

### **Operations & Certifications**
* **Organic Focus:** White Rock Specialties is a Certified Organic handling facility (certified by the Colorado Department of Agriculture). They adhere to strict GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) and GHP (Good Handling Practices) standards.
* **Volume & Shipping:** They ship year-round to customers coast-to-coast. While they primarily pack for their own farms (Rockey Farms and White Mountain Farm), they also pack product for outside growers in the San Luis Valley to help maintain year-round supply.
* **Sustainability:** Both founding farms are known for sustainable agricultural practices, including the use of cover crops ("green manure") to improve soil health and reduce water usage—a critical issue in the San Luis Valley.

### **Connection to Founding Farms**
* **Rockey Farms:** Famous for specialty varieties like fingerlings and their sustainable farming methods. Sheldon Rockey is a well-known figure in the potato industry and serves on various agricultural boards.
* **White Mountain Farm:** Known for being one of the first large-scale organic quinoa growers in Colorado, as well as a major producer of organic potatoes.
